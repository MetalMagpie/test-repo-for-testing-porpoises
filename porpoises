Porpoises are a group of fully aquatic marine mammals, similar in appearance to a dolphin, all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). They are, however, more closely related to narwhals and belugas than to the true dolphins.

Harbor porpoises survive primarily on fish and are among the smallest of the cetaceans, reaching an average size of about 5 feet and 121 pounds.
